      <h1>About <em>Alibi</em></h1>
      
      <h4 class="headline">
        <em>Alibi</em> is a new sort of magazine focused on literature and rock &amp; roll.  It’s published using a mix of traditional and innovative approaches – not only online, not only print, but a unique blend of the page, the stage, and the web. No high-quality magazine exists that presents rock music and literature side-by-side and explores their exhilarating relationship. Not until now.

          <h3>Live Events</h3>
          <p><em>Alibi</em> will present marquee live shows with the release of each quarterly issue, and our first event this winter will be headlined by Neko Case and a writer we’ll announce soon.  Each <em>Alibi</em> event will feature two marquee guests – an author and a musician.  The shows will include live interviews, performances, and collaborations.  The first few events will take place in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

          <h3><em>Alibi</em> on the Page</h3>
          <p>The print magazine will appear quarterly, and our first issue will feature new writing by by Tobias Wolff, Jim White, Zach Rogue, Kim Addonizio, Blake Hazard, Ted Gioia, Adrian McKinty, Viva Las Vegas, and many others.  The magazine will contain interviews, short stories, essays, and a handful of features in which musicians write about books and authors write about music.</p>

          <h3><em>Alibi</em> on the Web: Film, Audio, and Extras</h3>
          <p>The first <em>Alibi</em> mini-concert, a film featuring Zach from Rogue Wave, will be posted to the <em>Alibi</em> site soon, as well as brand new columns by Jim White and Viva Las Vegas.  The <em>Alibi</em> website will offer a series of mini-concerts and mini-readings, as well as columns, blogs, reviews, new songs, stories read aloud, interviews, and conversations.  Some of the content will be free to everyone, and some will be exclusively for subscribers.</p>

          <h3>Do It for the Kids</h3>
          <p>Education is important to us here at <em>Alibi</em>.  We plan to give copies of the magazine to schools and offer free student matinees of our events.  If we can inspire a few punks to grow up to be the next Tom Waits or Cormac McCarthy – or at least if we can light some sparks – that ain’t a bad thing.</p>
